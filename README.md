# YU Bazaar

**YU Bazaar** is a marketplace platform designed exclusively for York University students. It enables students to buy, sell, and swap items within a secure, trusted campus community, reducing reliance on external platforms and fostering student connections.

## Project Overview

YU Bazaar aims to simplify campus transactions for students by offering a student-centric marketplace with features tailored to their needs. Students can list items like textbooks, electronics, dorm furniture, and tickets for campus events, connecting directly with their peers. This project prioritizes ease of use, campus safety, and community engagement.

## Motivation 

**YU Bazaar** was created to address the unique needs of York University students by providing a safe, accessible, and on-campus platform for trading items like textbooks, electronics, dorm furniture, and event tickets. Existing platforms lack campus-specific focus, security, and student-centered categories, limiting their usefulness for York students. By fostering a localized and student-only marketplace, YU Bazaar enhances community engagement and provides convenience for campus-related transactions.

### Goals of Sprint 0

Sprint 0 focuses on establishing the foundational elements of the platform. Our objectives are to:
1. Set up the project repository and development environment.
2. Outline the primary project goals, features, and roadmap.
3. Define initial user stories and the product backlog to guide future development.
4. Establish basic project documentation, including user flows and preliminary wireframes.

## Competitive Analysis

A unique feature of YU Bazaar is its exclusive focus on York University students, offering features that are missing from popular marketplaces like Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, and Karrot. By focusing on campus-specific categories, privacy, and a trusted, York-only user base, YU Bazaar differentiates itself from broader platforms.

## Project Goals and Differentiation

YU Bazaar is dedicated to building a campus-centric marketplace that balances security, ease of use, and community. Unlike generic marketplaces, YU Bazaar is built specifically for York University, supporting student-to-student interactions through:
- **Dedicated categories** for textbooks, dorm essentials, and club events.
- **Enhanced privacy** through on-campus meeting arrangements without the need to share personal contact information.
- **York-exclusive user access** to foster a safe, student-driven community.
