## **Decisions Made**  
1. User registration and login system should be implemented with email verification first, then progress to social login options.  
2. Profile editing features should allow only essential fields (e.g., name, email) to be updated to ensure proper data management.  
3. Item listing system should allow both users and admins to add, edit, and delete listings; ensure proper categorization and visibility to other users.
