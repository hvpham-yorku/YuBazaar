# Process: YU Bazaar Project

## Team Organization (Roles)
To ensure efficient collaboration, our team roles were clearly defined from the start:
- **Project Manager**: Ojas – Responsible for setting timelines, organizing meetings, and facilitating smooth communication across the team. Ojas also tracked task completion and ensured all members stayed aligned with project goals.
- **Front-end Developers**: Ojas and Sourav – Focused on creating the user-facing aspects of YU Bazaar, including item listings, search and filter functionalities, and overall user interaction. They worked closely with the UI/UX Designer to ensure consistency in design and usability.
- **Back-end Developers**: Vedant and Krish – Worked on the server-side aspects of the marketplace, handling data management, user authentication, and transaction processing. They also helped set up the MVC structure essential for our early prototype.
- **UI/UX Designer**: Krish – Designed an intuitive, user-friendly interface, focusing on accessibility and ease of use. This role was crucial in ensuring our marketplace met the project goal of facilitating frequent transactions in a straightforward manner.
- **Documentation Leads**: Sourav and Vedant – Created and maintained documentation for the project, including summary.md, process.md, and user stories. They ensured our documentation accurately reflected our progress and goals, making it easier for the team to stay coordinated.

## Decision Making
Our decision-making process was collaborative and transparent. For each significant decision, such as the direction of product design, prioritization of features, or specific technical approaches, we gathered input from all team members. Discussions were held openly during meetings, and we ensured every voice was heard. To finalize decisions, we used a simple majority vote where needed, but in most cases, consensus was reached through open dialogue. When we encountered technical disagreements, the Project Manager, Ojas, facilitated a discussion to weigh pros and cons, helping us decide on the best approach collectively.

## Prioritizing User Stories
User stories were prioritized based on the following criteria:
1. **User Relevance and Impact**: User stories that had the highest relevance to York University students—such as textbook buying/selling, event ticket sales, and convenient item exchanges—were prioritized. We wanted to address the most common and pressing needs first.
2. **Project Timeline**: Stories that were critical to our sprint goals and aligned with the initial MVC setup were prioritized to create a functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) quickly.
3. **Feasibility and Dependencies**: We considered the complexity of each story and dependencies on other functionalities. Stories that enabled further features or had fewer dependencies were prioritized. On average, we required one round of voting to assign points, although more complex stories sometimes needed a follow-up vote.

## Meeting Structure and Frequency
Our meeting structure was systematic, with each session contributing to a clear milestone:
- **First Meeting**: Created a team contract, outlining roles, expectations, and shared responsibilities. This provided a strong foundation for our collaboration.
- **Second Meeting**: Drafted summary.md to identify key users and usage scenarios, focusing on our core user groups and their anticipated interactions on the platform.
- **Third Meeting**: Analyzed competing platforms and discussed how YU Bazaar would differentiate itself, particularly in terms of campus safety, ease of use, and local community focus.
- **Fourth Meeting (Long)**: We conducted an in-depth session where we created personas for hypothetical users (e.g., Person A, B, and C) to clarify target demographics. Based on these personas, we identified and defined 25 essential user stories, ensuring they aligned with our project goals.
- **Subsequent Meetings**: Established the MVC architecture for the project, designed the initial UI/UX layout, and created process.md and done.md. These meetings were crucial in aligning the team with the technical and design aspects of the platform. In our most recent meeting, README.md was created, and we divided front-end and back-end tasks for sprint 1, setting clear objectives for each sub-team.

## Lessons for the Next Phase
Reflecting on our progress so far, we identified several key lessons to carry forward:
- **Enhanced Task Allocation**: In future phases, assigning tasks more closely aligned with individual strengths and areas of expertise could further improve efficiency and productivity.
- **Early Testing and Feedback Loops**: Conducting user testing at earlier stages in development will help catch potential issues sooner, allowing us to make iterative improvements rather than extensive fixes later.
- **Consistent Use of Project Management Tools**: Using dedicated tools, such as Trello or Asana, consistently throughout the next phase can enhance task tracking and ensure all team members are aligned with project progress and timelines.
- **Documentation as a Continuous Process**: We found that updating documentation consistently is essential for team clarity. In future phases, we will ensure that documents like process.md and done.md are updated regularly, reflecting ongoing progress and any changes in our approach.
