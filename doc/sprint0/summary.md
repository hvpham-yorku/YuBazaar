# YU Bazaar Project Overview

## Objective
YU Bazaar is a marketplace platform enabling York University students to purchase, sell, and swap products conveniently on campus. This initiative intends to improve student-to-student interactions by providing an accessible, safe, and efficient marketplace, minimizing dependency on external platforms like Facebook Marketplace, and cultivating a local community.

## Key Users
- **York University Students**: The primary users who will buy and sell items such as textbooks, electronics, clothing, and furniture.
- **Faculty and Staff (Secondary Users)**: Faculty may use the platform to purchase student-sold items or post giveaways for items relevant to students.

## Key Use Cases
1. **Listing an Item for Sale**: Users can create item listings with details, photos, and pricing.
2. **Searching and Filtering Items**: Users can browse, and filter listings based on categories, price range, and location on campus.
3. **Transaction and Delivery Coordination**: Users can arrange for item pickup locations on campus, making it convenient for both parties.

## Key Usage Scenarios
1. **Student Buying a Textbook**: A student searches for a specific textbook, filters by condition and price, and contacts the seller for a meetup.
2. **Club Selling Event Tickets**: A campus club lists event tickets, with students able to browse and purchase tickets within YU Bazaar.
3. **Apartment Move-Out Sale**: A graduating student lists various items for sale, which other students can browse through and purchase affordably.

## Project Goals
1. **Ease of Use**: Intuitive interface and smooth user experience to facilitate frequent transactions.
2. **Campus Safety**: Ensuring secure communication, privacy, and vetted user base limited to York University community.
3. **Scalability**: Designed for potential future expansion to integrate additional York University resources or partnerships.
