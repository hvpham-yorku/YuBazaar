# Definition of Done - YU Bazaar Project

The Definition of Done (DoD) ensures that all user stories and features meet the agreed quality standards before being marked as completed. This document includes standard and additional criteria, which apply to all user stories in the project backlog.

## Standard Definition of Done

For a user story or feature to be considered "Done," it must meet the following criteria:

1. **Code Development**
   - Code has been implemented according to the acceptance criteria defined in the user stories that are present on Trello.
   - Code follows the project's established style guidelines and coding standards.
   - All business logic and functionality have been reviewed and are correct.

2. **Code Review**
   - Code has been reviewed by at least one team member.
   - All review feedback has been addressed.
   - Code meets the team's quality and readability standards.

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests are implemented and pass for all core functionalities.
   - Integration tests confirm that components interact correctly.
   - User Acceptance Testing (UAT) has been performed, and the story meets user expectations.

4. **Documentation**
   - Code is documented, including comments for complex logic.
   - Relevant updates have been made to README, if applicable.
   - User-facing features are documented in the user guide.

5. **Security and Compliance**
   - Code follows security best practices (e.g., input validation, proper error handling).
   - Compliance with privacy and data handling policies (e.g., user data handling).

6. **Deployment**
   - Code has been deployed to the environment as feature is according to the expectations.

## Additional Definition of Done (Specific to YU Bazaar)

In addition to the standard criteria, the following criteria are specific to the YU Bazaar project:

1. **User Verification and Access Control**
   - Only verified users (York University email) can access protected areas.
   - Roles (e.g., admin, buyer, seller) are enforced with correct permissions.

2. **Feature-Specific Requirements**
   - Each user story meets the defined Criteria of Satisfaction in the Product Backlog (e.g., successful registration, item listing, transaction history).
   - All mandatory fields and constraints specified in the user stories are enforced (e.g., email verification for registration).

3. **Design and Usability**
   - UI/UX is consistent with the project's design guidelines.
   - Features are tested for accessibility and ease of use if time permits.
   - Responsive design is verified across devices and screen sizes.

4. **Notifications and Alerts**
   - Notifications function as specified in the user stories.
   - Alerts are clear, actionable, and relevant to user actions (e.g., new listings, transactions).

5. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Errors are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages.
   - Logging is implemented for debugging and monitoring purposes, without exposing sensitive information.

6. **Final Approval**
   - The Product Owner(User) and QA have reviewed and approved the feature.
   - All acceptance criteria are met, and the feature has passed final review.
